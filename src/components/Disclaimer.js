      <h1>NOTES</h1>
      <p>I elected to not include Clayton Kershaw and Justin Verlander's MVP season due to them being pitchers. In addition, I was not able to list Shohei Ohtani's pitching statistics. This is due to having troubles with using react to display data that was null for some players and relevant for others; I had to use batting stats only. </p>
